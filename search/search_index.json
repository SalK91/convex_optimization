It is a key step in many algorithms (projected gradient, alternating projections, etc.) to enforce constraints. Geometrically, projections are about \u201cdropping perpendiculars\u201d to a subspace or convex set.</p> <p>Projection onto a subspace: Let \\(W \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n\\) be a subspace (e.g. defined by a set of linear equations \\(Ax=0\\) or spanned by some basis vectors). The orthogonal projection of any \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) onto \\(W\\) is the unique point \\(P_W(x) \\in W\\) such that \\(x - P_W(x)\\) is orthogonal to \\(W\\). If \\({q_1,\\dots,q_k}\\) is an orthonormal basis of \\(W\\), then \u200b  </p> <p>as mentioned earlier. This \\(P_W(x)\\) minimizes the distance \\(|x - y|2\\) over all \\(y\\in W\\). The residual \\(r = x - P_W(x)\\) is orthogonal to every direction in \\(W\\). For example, projecting a point in space onto a plane is dropping a perpendicular to the plane. In \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), \\(P_W\\) is an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix (if \\(W\\) is \\(k\\)-dimensional, \\(P_W\\) has rank \\(k\\)) that satisfies \\(P_W^2 = P_W\\) (idempotent) and \\(P_W = P_W^T\\) (symmetric). In optimization, if we are constrained to \\(W\\), a projected gradient step does \\(x_{k+1} = P_W(x_k - \\alpha \\nabla f(x_k))\\) to ensure \\(x_{k+1} \\in W\\).</p> <p>Projection onto a convex set: More generally, for a closed convex set \\(C \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\), the projection \\(\\operatorname{proj}_C(x)\\) is defined as the unique point in \\(C\\) closest to \\(x\\):</p> \\[ P_C(x) = \\arg\\min_{y \\in C} \\|x - y\\|_2 \\] <p>For convex \\(C\\), this best approximation exists and is unique. While we may not have a simple formula like in the subspace case, projections onto many sets have known formulas or efficient algorithms (e.g. projecting onto a box \\([l,u]\\) just clips each coordinate between \\(l\\) and \\(u\\)). Some properties of convex projections: </p> <ul> <li> <p>\\(P_C(x)\\) lies on the boundary of \\(C\\) along the direction of \\(x\\) if \\(x \\notin C\\). </p> </li> <li> <p>The first-order optimality condition for the minimization above says \\((x - P_C(x))\\) is orthogonal to the tangent of \\(C\\) at \\(P_C(x)\\), or equivalently \\(\\langle x - P_C(x), y - P_C(x)\\rangle \\le 0\\) for all \\(y \\in C\\). This means the line from \\(P_C(x)\\) to \\(x\\) forms a supporting hyperplane to \\(C\\) at \\(P_C(x)\\). </p> </li> <li>Also, projections are firmly non-expansive: \\(|P_C(x)-P_C(y)|^2 \\le \\langle P_C(x)-P_C(y), x-y \\rangle \\le |x-y|^2\\). Intuitively, projecting cannot increase distances and in fact pulls points closer in a very controlled way. This is important for convergence of algorithms like alternating projections and proximal point methods, ensuring stability.</li> </ul> <p>Examples:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Projection onto an affine set \\(Ax=b\\) (assuming it\u2019s consistent) can be derived via normal equations: one finds a correction \\(\\delta x\\) in the row space of \\(A^T\\) such that \\(A(x+\\delta x)=b\\). The solution is \\(P_C(x) = x - A^T(AA^T)^{-1}(Ax-b)\\) (for full row rank \\(A\\)).</p> </li> <li> <p>Projection onto the nonnegative orthant \\({x: x_i\\ge0}\\) just sets \\(x_i^- = \\min(x_i,0)\\) to zero (i.e. \\([x]^+ = \\max{x,0}\\) componentwise). This is used in nonnegativity constraints.</p> </li> <li> <p>Projection onto an \\(\\ell_2\\) ball \\({|x|_2 \\le \\alpha}\\) scales \\(x\\) down to have length \\(\\alpha\\) if \\(|x|&gt;\\alpha\\), or does nothing if \\(|x|\\le\\alpha\\).</p> </li> <li> <p>Projection onto an \\(\\ell_1\\) ball (for sparsity) is more involved but essentially does soft-thresholding on coordinates to make the sum of absolute values equal \\(\\alpha\\).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Why projections matter in optimization: Many convex optimization problems involve constraints \\(x \\in C\\) where \\(C\\) is convex. If we can compute \\(P_C(x)\\) easily, we can use projection-based algorithms. For instance, projected gradient descent: if we move in the negative gradient direction and then project back to \\(C\\), we guarantee the iterate stays feasible and we still decrease the objective (for small enough step). The property of projections that \\((x - P_C(x))\\) is orthogonal to the feasible region at \\(P_C(x)\\) connects to KKT conditions: at optimum \\(\\hat{x}\\) with \\(\\hat{x} = P_C(x^* - \\alpha \\nabla f(\\hat{x}))\\), the vector \\(-\\nabla f(\\hat{x})\\) must lie in the normal cone of \\(C\\) at \\(\\hat{x}\\), meaning the gradient is \u201cbalanced\u201d by the constraint boundary \u2014 this is exactly the intuition behind Lagrange multipliers. In fact, one of the KKT conditions can be seen as stating that \\(\\hat{x} = P_C(x^* - \\alpha \\nabla f(x^*))\\) for some step \\(\\alpha\\), i.e. you cannot find a feasible direction that improves the objective (otherwise the projection of a slight step would move along that direction).</p> <p>Orthogonal decomposition: Any vector \\(x\\) can be uniquely decomposed relative to a subspace \\(W\\) as \\(x = P_W(x) + r\\) with \\(r \\perp W\\). Moreover, \\(|x|^2 = |P_W(x)|^2 + |r|^2\\) (Pythagorean theorem). This orthogonal decomposition is a geometric way to understand degrees of freedom. In constrained optimization with constraint \\(x\\in W\\), any descent direction \\(d\\) can be split into a part tangent to \\(W\\) (which actually moves within \\(W\\)) and a part normal to \\(W\\) (which violates constraints). Feasible directions are those with no normal component. At optimum, the gradient \\(\\nabla f(x^)\\) being orthogonal to the feasible region means \\(\\nabla f(x^)\\) lies entirely in the normal subspace \\(W^\\perp\\) \u2014 no component lies along any feasible direction. This is exactly the condition for optimality with equality constraints: \\(\\nabla f(x^)\\) is in the row space of \\(A\\) if \\(Ax^=b\\) are active constraints, which leads to \\(\\nabla f(x^*) = A^T \\lambda\\) for some \\(\\lambda\\) (the Lagrange multipliers). Thus, orthogonal decomposition underpins the optimality conditions in constrained problems.</p> <p>Projection algorithms: The simplicity or difficulty of computing \\(P_C(x)\\) often determines if we can solve a problem efficiently. If \\(C\\) is something like a polyhedron given by linear inequalities, \\(P_C\\) might require solving a QP each time. But for many simple sets (boxes, balls, simplices, spectral norm or nuclear norm balls, etc.), we have closed forms. This gives rise to the toolbox of proximal operators in convex optimization, which generalize projections to include objective terms. Proximal gradient methods rely on computing \\(\\operatorname{prox}{\\gamma g}(x) = \\arg\\min_y {g(y) + \\frac{1}{2\\gamma}|y-x|^2}\\), which for indicator functions of set \\(C\\) yields \\(\\operatorname{prox}{\\delta_C}(x) = P_C(x)\\). Thus projection is a special proximal operator (one for constraints).</p> <p>In conclusion, projections are how we enforce constraints and decompose optimization problems. They appear in the analysis of alternating projection algorithms (for finding a point in \\(C_1 \\cap C_2\\) by \\(x_{k+1}=P_{C_1}(P_{C_2}(x_k))\\)), in augmented Lagrangian methods (where a proximal term causes an update like a projection), and in many other contexts. Mastering the geometry of projections \u2014 that the closest point condition yields orthogonality conditions and that projections do not expand distances \u2014 is crucial for understanding how constraint-handling algorithms converge.</p>"},{"location":"appendices/140_support/","title":"Appendix C - Support Functions and Dual Geometry (Advanced)","text":""},{"location":"appendices/140_support/#appendix-b-support-functions-and-dual-geometry-advanced","title":"Appendix B: Support Functions and Dual Geometry (Advanced)","text":"<p>This appendix develops a geometric viewpoint on duality using support functions, hyperplane separation, and polarity.</p>"},{"location":"appendices/140_support/#b1-support-functions","title":"B.1 Support functions","text":"<p>Let \\(C \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n\\) be a nonempty set.

Inner products allow us to talk about orthogonality (perpendicular vectors) and orthogonal projections, and to define the all-important concept of a gradient in optimization. </p> <p>Geometry from the inner product: An inner product induces a norm \\(\\|x\\| = \\sqrt{\\langle x,x \\rangle}\\) and a notion of distance \\(d(x,y) = \\|x-y\\|\\). It also defines angles: \\(\\langle x,y \\rangle = 0\\) means \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are orthogonal. Thus, inner products generalize the geometric concepts of lengths and angles to abstract vector spaces. Many results in Euclidean geometry (like the Pythagorean theorem and law of cosines) hold in any inner product space. For example, the parallelogram law holds: \\(\\|x+y\\|^2 + \\|x-y\\|^2 = 2\\|x\\|^2 + 2\\|y\\|^2\\).  </p> <p>The Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality: For any \\(x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\):  with equality iff \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are linearly dependent Geometrically, it means the absolute inner product is maximized when \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) point in the same or opposite direction. </p> <p>Examples of inner products:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Standard (Euclidean) inner product: \\(\\langle x,y\\rangle = x^\\top y = \\sum_i x_i y_i\\). This underlies most optimization algorithms on \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), where \\(\\nabla f(x)\\) is defined via this inner product (so that \\(\\langle \\nabla f(x), h\\rangle\\) gives the directional derivative in direction \\(h\\)).  </p> </li> <li> <p>Weighted inner product: \\(\\langle x,y\\rangle_W = x^\\top W y\\) for some symmetric positive-definite matrix \\(W\\). Here \\(\\|x\\|_W = \\sqrt{x^\\top W x}\\) is a weighted length. Such inner products appear in preconditioning: by choosing \\(W\\) cleverly, one can measure distances in a way that accounts for scaling in the problem (e.g. the Mahalanobis distance uses \\(W = \\Sigma^{-1}\\) for covariance \\(\\Sigma\\)).  </p> </li> <li> <p>Function space inner product: \\(\\langle f, g \\rangle = \\int_a^b f(t)\\,g(t)\\,dt\\). This turns the space of square-integrable functions on \\([a,b]\\) into an inner product space (a Hilbert space, \\(L^2[a,b]\\)). In machine learning, this is the basis for kernel Hilbert spaces, where one defines an inner product between functions to lift optimization into infinite-dimensional feature spaces.  </p> </li> </ul> <p>Any vector space with an inner product has an orthonormal basis (via the Gram\u2013Schmidt process). Gram\u2013Schmidt is fundamental in numerical algorithms to orthogonalize vectors and is used to derive the QR decomposition: any full-rank matrix \\(A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}\\) can be factored as \\(A = QR\\) where \\(Q\\) has orthonormal columns and \\(R\\) is upper triangular. This factorization is widely used in least squares and optimization because it provides a stable way to solve \\(Ax=b\\) and to analyze subspaces. For example, for an overdetermined system (\\(m&gt;n\\) i.e. more equations than unknowns), \\(Ax=b\\) has a least-squares solution \\(x = R^{-1}(Q^\\top b)\\), and for underdetermined (\\(m&lt;n\\)), \\(Ax=b\\) has infinitely many solutions, among which one often chooses the minimal-norm solution using the orthonormal basis of the range. </p> <p>Applications in optimization: Inner product geometry is indispensable in convex optimization.  </p> <ul> <li> <p>Gradients: The gradient \\(\\nabla f(x)\\) is defined as the vector satisfying \\(f(x+h)\\approx f(x) + \\langle \\nabla f(x), h\\rangle\\). Thus the inner product induces the notion of steepest ascent/descent direction (steepest descent is in direction \\(-\\nabla f(x)\\) because it minimizes the inner product with the gradient). If we changed the inner product (using a matrix \\(W\\)), the notion of gradient would change accordingly (this idea is used in natural gradient methods).  </p> </li> <li> <p>Orthogonal projections: Many algorithms require projecting onto a constraint set. For linear constraints \\(Ax=b\\) (an affine set), the projection formula uses the inner product to find the closest point in the affine set. Projections also underpin least squares problems (solution is projection of \\(b\\) onto \\(\\mathrm{range}(A)\\)) and quadratic programs (where each iteration might involve a projection).  </p> </li> <li> <p>Orthonormal representations: Orthonormal bases (like principal components) simplify optimization by diagonalizing quadratic forms or separating variables. For instance, in PCA we use an orthonormal basis (eigenvectors) to reduce dimensionality. In iterative algorithms, working in an orthonormal basis aligned with the problem (e.g. preconditioning) can accelerate convergence.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Conditioning and Gram matrix: The inner product concept leads to the Gram matrix \\(G_{ij} = \\langle x_i, x_j\\rangle\\) for a set of vectors. In machine learning, the Gram matrix (or kernel matrix) encodes similarity of features and appears in the normal equations for least squares: \\(X^\\top X\\) is a Gram matrix whose eigenvalues tell us about problem conditioning. A well-conditioned Gram matrix (no tiny eigenvalues) means the problem is nicely scaled for gradient descent, whereas ill-conditioning (some nearly zero eigenvalues) means there are directions in weight space that are very flat, slowing convergence. Techniques like feature scaling or adding regularization (ridge regression) improve the Gram matrix\u2019s condition number and thus algorithm performance.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"convex/12_vector/#24-norms-and-distances","title":"2.4 Norms and distances","text":"<p>A function \\(\\|\\cdot\\|: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) is a norm if for all \\(x,y\\) and scalar \\(\\alpha\\):</p> <ol> <li>\\(\\|x\\| \\ge 0\\) and \\(\\|x\\| = 0 \\iff x=0\\),</li> <li>\\(\\|\\alpha x\\| = |\\alpha|\\|x\\|\\) (absolute homogeneity),</li> <li>\\(\\|x+y\\| \\le \\|x\\| + \\|y\\|\\) (triangle inequality).</li> </ol> <p>If the vector space has an inner product, the norm \\(\\|x\\| = \\sqrt{\\langle x,x\\rangle}\\) is called the Euclidean norm (or 2-norm).

Norms thus define the shape of \u201cballs\u201d (sets \\({x: |x|\\le \\text{constant}}\\)) and how we measure closeness. The choice of norm can significantly influence an optimization algorithm\u2019s behavior: it affects what steps are considered small, which directions are easy to move in, and how convergence is assessed.</p> <p></p> <p>Unit-ball geometry: The shape of the unit ball \\({x: |x| \\le 1}\\) reveals how a norm treats different directions. For example, the \\(\\ell_2\\) unit ball in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) is a perfect circle, treating all directions uniformly, whereas the \\(\\ell_1\\) unit ball is a diamond with corners along the axes, indicating that \\(\\ell_1\\) treats the coordinate axes as special (those are \u201ccheaper\u201d directions since the ball extends further along axes, touching them at \\((\\pm1,0)\\) and \\((0,\\pm1)\\)). The \\(\\ell_\\infty\\) unit ball is a square aligned with axes, suggesting it allows more combined motion in coordinates as long as no single coordinate exceeds the limit. These shapes are illustrated below: we see the red diamond (\\(\\ell_1\\)), green circle (\\(\\ell_2\\)), and blue square (\\(\\ell_\\infty\\)) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) . The geometry of the unit ball matters whenever we regularize or constrain solutions by a norm. For instance, using an \\(\\ell_1\\) norm ball as a constraint or regularizer encourages solutions on the corners (sparse solutions), while an \\(\\ell_2\\) ball encourages more evenly-distributed changes. An \\(\\ell_\\infty\\) constraint limits the maximum absolute value of any component, leading to solutions that avoid any single large entry.</p> <p>Dual norms: Each norm \\(\\|\\cdot\\|\\) has a dual norm \\(\\|\\cdot\\|_*\\) defined by  For example, the dual of \\(\\ell_1\\) is \\(\\ell_\\infty\\), and the dual of \\(\\ell_2\\) is itself.</p> <p>Imagine the vector \\(x\\) lives inside the original norm ball (\\(\\|x\\| \\le 1\\)). The term \\(x^\\top y\\) is the dot product, which measures the alignment between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). The dual norm \\(\\|y\\|_*\\) is the maximum possible value you can get by taking the dot product of \\(y\\) with any vector \\(x\\) that fits inside the original norm ball.If the dual norm \\(\\|y\\|_*\\) is large, it means \\(y\\) is strongly aligned with a direction \\(x\\) that is \"small\" (size \\(\\le 1\\)) according to the original norm.If the dual norm is small, \\(y\\) must be poorly aligned with all vectors \\(x\\) in the ball.</p> <p>Norms in optimization algorithms: Different norms define different algorithmic behaviors. For example, gradient descent typically uses the Euclidean norm for step sizes and convergence analysis, but coordinate descent methods implicitly use \\(\\ell_\\infty\\) (since one coordinate move at a time is like a step in \\(\\ell_\\infty\\) unit ball). Mirror descent methods use non-Euclidean norms and their duals to get better performance on certain problems (e.g. using \\(\\ell_1\\) norm for sparse problems). The norm also figures in complexity bounds: an algorithm\u2019s convergence rate may depend on the diameter of the feasible set in the chosen norm, \\(D = \\max_{\\text{feasible}}|x - x^*|\\). For instance, in subgradient methods, having a smaller \\(\\ell_2\\) diameter or \\(\\ell_1\\) diameter can improve bounds. Moreover, when constraints are given by norms (like \\(|x|_1 \\le t\\)), projections and proximal operators with respect to that norm become subroutines in algorithms.</p> <p>In summary, norms provide the metric backbone of optimization. They tell us how to measure progress (\\(|x_k - x^*|\\)), how to constrain solutions (\\(|x| \\le R\\)), and how to bound errors. The choice of norm can induce sparsity, robustness, or other desired structure in solutions, and mastering norms and their geometry is key to understanding advanced optimization techniques.</p>"},{"location":"convex/12_vector/#25-eigenvalues-eigenvectors-and-positive-semidefinite-matrices","title":"2.5 Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and positive semidefinite matrices","text":"<p>If \\(A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}\\) is linear, a nonzero \\(v\\) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) if</p> \\[ Av = \\lambda v~. \\] <p>When \\(A\\) is symmetric (\\(A = A^\\top\\)), it has:</p> <ul> <li>real eigenvalues,</li> <li>an orthonormal eigenbasis,</li> <li>a spectral decomposition</li> </ul> <p>  where \\(Q\\) is orthonormal and \\(\\Lambda\\) is diagonal.</p> <p>This is the spectral decomposition.

Newton\u2019s method uses Hessian inverse, effectively rescaling by eigenvalues to 1, so its performance is invariant to \\(\\kappa\\) (locally).

Directions with large eigenvalues are steep, potentially requiring small step sizes to maintain stability if using gradient descent.
