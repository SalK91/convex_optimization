Linear algebra not only studies vectors but also linear operators (matrices) that act on these vectors. In optimization, matrices represent constraint gradients, Hessians, update rules, etc., so understanding their action is crucial. We focus here on measuring how “big” a linear operator is and how it distorts space, which leads to the ideas of operator norms and singular values.

**Operator norm:** Given a matrix (linear map) $A: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ and given a choice of vector norms on input and output, one can define the induced operator norm. If we use $|\cdot|_p$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $|\cdot|_q$ on $\mathbb{R}^m$, the operator norm is

$$
\|A\|_{p \to q}
= \sup_{x \ne 0} \frac{\|Ax\|_q}{\|x\|_p}
= \sup_{\|x\|_p \le 1} \|Ax\|_q
$$


This gives the maximum factor by which $A$ can stretch a vector (measuring $x$ in norm $p$ and $Ax$ in norm $q$).pecial cases are common: with $p = q = 2$, $|A|_{2 \to 2}$ (often just written $|A|_2$) is the spectral norm, which equals the largest singular value of $A$ (more on singular values below).
If $p = q = 1$, $|A|_{1 \to 1}$ is the maximum absolute column sum of $A$.
If $p = q = \infty$, $|A|{\infty \to \infty}$ is the maximum absolute row sum.

Operator norms tell us the worst-case amplification of signals by $A$. In gradient descent on $f(x) = \tfrac{1}{2} x^\top A x - b^\top x$ (a quadratic form), the step size must be $\le \tfrac{2}{|A|_2}$ for convergence; here $|A|_2 = \lambda_{\max}(A)$ if $A$ is symmetric (it’s related to Hessian eigenvalues, Chapter 5). In general, controlling $|A|$ controls stability: if $|A| < 1$, the map brings vectors closer (contraction mapping), important in fixed-point algorithms.

**Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):** Any matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ can be factored as

$$
A = U \Sigma V^\top
$$


where $U \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$ and $V \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ are orthogonal matrices (their columns are orthonormal bases of $\mathbb{R}^m$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$, respectively), and $\Sigma$ is an $m\times n$ diagonal matrix with nonnegative entries $\sigma_1 \ge \sigma_2 \ge \cdots \ge 0$ on the diagonal. The $\sigma_i$ are the singular values of $A$. Geometrically, $A$ sends the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$ to an ellipsoid in $\mathbb{R}^m$ whose principal semi-axes lengths are the singular values and directions are the columns of $V$ (mapped to columns of $U$). The largest singular value $\sigma_{\max} = |A|_2$ is the spectral norm. The smallest (if $n \le m$, $\sigma{\min}$ of those $n$) indicates how $A$ contracts the least – if $\sigma_{\min} = 0$, $A$ is rank-deficient.

The SVD is a fundamental tool for analyzing linear maps in optimization: it reveals the condition number $\kappa(A) = \sigma_{\max}/\sigma_{\min}$ (when $\sigma_{\min}>0$), which measures how stretched the map is in one direction versus another. High condition number means ill-conditioning: some directions in $x$-space hardly change $Ax$ (flat curvature), making it hard for algorithms to progress uniformly. Low condition number means $A$ is close to an orthogonal scaling, which is ideal. SVD is also used for dimensionality reduction: truncating small singular values gives the best low-rank approximation of $A$ (Eckart–Young theorem), widely used in PCA and compressive sensing. In convex optimization, many second-order methods or constraint eliminations use eigen or singular values to simplify problems.

**Low-rank structure:** The rank of $A$ equals the number of nonzero singular values. If $A$ has rank $r \ll \min(n,m)$, it means $A$ effectively operates in a low-dimensional subspace. This often can be exploited: the data or constraints have some latent low-dimensional structure. Many convex optimization techniques (like nuclear norm minimization) aim to produce low-rank solutions by leveraging singular values. Conversely, if an optimization problem’s data matrix $A$ is low-rank, one can often compress it (via SVD) to speed up computations or reduce variables.

**Operator norm in optimization:** Operator norms also guide step sizes and preconditioning. As noted, for a quadratic problem $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^TQx - b^Tx$, the Hessian is $Q$ and gradient descent converges if $\alpha < 2/\lambda_{\max}(Q)$. Preconditioning aims to transform $Q$ into one with a smaller condition number by multiplying by some $P$ (like using $P^{-1}Q$) — effectively changing the norm in which we measure lengths, so the operator norm becomes smaller. In first-order methods for general convex $f$, the Lipschitz constant of $\nabla f$ (which often equals a spectral norm of a Hessian or Jacobian) determines convergence rates.

**Summary of spectral properties:**

- The **spectral norm** $|A|_2 = \sigma_{\max}(A)$ quantifies the largest stretching. It determines stability and step sizes.

- The smallest singular value $\sigma_{\min}$ (if $A$ is tall full-rank) tells if $A$ is invertible and how sensitive the inverse is. If $\sigma_{\min}$ is tiny, small changes in output cause huge changes in solving $Ax=b$.

- The **condition number** $\kappa = \sigma_{\max}/\sigma_{\min}$ is a figure of merit for algorithms: gradient descent iterations needed often scale with $\kappa$ (worse conditioning = slower). Regularization like adding $\mu I$ increases $\sigma_{\min}$, thereby reducing $\kappa$ and accelerating convergence (at the expense of bias).

- **Nuclear norm** (sum of singular values) and **spectral norm** often appear in optimization as convex surrogates for rank and as constraints to limit the operator’s impact.

In machine learning, one often whitens data (via SVD of the covariance) to improve conditioning, or uses truncated SVD to compress features. In sum, understanding singular values and operator norms equips us to diagnose and improve algorithmic performance for convex optimization problems.
