# Mathematics for Machine Learning

Welcome to *Mathematics for Machine Learning*, a structured set of lecture notes designed to build the mathematical foundation needed to understand and develop modern machine learning and optimization algorithms.

This digital book provides a unified, intuition-driven exploration of key mathematical tools — from linear algebra and calculus to convex analysis, optimization, and algorithms used in deep learning and natural language processing (NLP).

## Motivation

Machine Learning, Optimization, and AI systems all rest upon a shared mathematical backbone. This resource aims to bridge the gap between abstract theory and practical application by offering:

* Concise derivations of essential results
* Geometric intuition and figures where helpful
* Connections to real-world algorithms (gradient descent, regularization, duality, etc.)
* Appendices that extend into more advanced or specialized topics

Whether you’re a student, researcher, or practitioner, this webbook provides both a reference and a learning guide.
