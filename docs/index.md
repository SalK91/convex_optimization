Convex optimisation is one of the central pillars of modern applied mathematics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. It provides a rich framework in which we can model problems, design algorithms, and guarantee performance. Unlike general non-convex optimisation, convex optimisation problems enjoy the key property that any **local solution is also global**. This makes them especially important in practice, where reliability, interpretability, and theoretical guarantees are valued.
