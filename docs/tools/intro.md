Snowflake

Proven experience in agentic frameworks (using CruxAI, Google ADK, LangGraph).


Multi-agent systems using frameworks such as LangChain, LangGraph, AutoGen, or CrewAI, with practical understanding of LLM orchestration, retrieval augmentation (RAG), tool calling, and dynamic reasoning.

Experience integrating agentic systems into enterprise data and workflow environments, ensuring robustness, and maintainability.

Proficiency in Python, with experience extending orchestration components and building APIs or tool interfaces.

Experience deploying AI systems on cloud platforms using Docker, Kubernetes, and microservices integration.

Experience deploying and optimising GenAI and LLM-based systems, including performance evaluation and monitoring.

Strong object-oriented programming skills and experience working with Python, PyTorch and NumPy are desirable
Experience in one or more advanced optimisation methods, modern ML techniques, HPC, profiling, model inference; you don’t need to have all of the above
Excellent ML reasoning and communication skills are crucial: off-the-shelf methods don’t always work on our data so you will need to understand how to develop your own models in a collaborative environment working in a team with complementary skills
