# 📋 KYC & AML Cheat Sheet

## 1. The Umbrella Term
### 🛡️ AML (Anti-Money Laundering)
* **What it is:** The overarching laws and regulations preventing criminals from disguising illegal funds as legitimate income.
* **Talking Point:** "AML is the entire framework we use to stop financial crime; KYC is just one part of that framework."

## 2. Establishing Identity (Onboarding Phase)
### 🆔 Identity Verification (IDV)
* **What it is:** Verifying that a user exists by checking data (Name, DOB, Address) against reliable databases.
* **Talking Point:** "First, we answer the question: 'Does this person actually exist?'"

### 📄 Document Verification
* **What it is:** Validating the authenticity of a physical ID (Passport/Driver's License) using forensic scanning (holograms, fonts).
* **Talking Point:** "We don't just trust the data; we verify the physical document is not a forgery."

## 3. Screening (The "Are you dangerous?" Phase)
### 🚫 Sanctions Screening (OFAC)
* **What it is:** Checking users against government blocklists (e.g., terrorists, sanctioned nations like North Korea).
* **Talking Point:** "This is a hard block. If you are on an OFAC list, we legally cannot do business with you."

### 🏛️ PEP Screening (Politically Exposed Persons)
* **What it is:** identifying individuals with prominent public roles (Senators, Heads of State) who are higher risk for bribery/corruption.
* **Talking Point:** "PEPs aren't criminals, but they require extra scrutiny because their position makes them vulnerable to corruption."

### 📰 Adverse Media Checking
* **What it is:** Scanning news and web sources for negative press (fraud, arrests) that hasn't hit a formal sanctions list yet.
* **Talking Point:** "Someone might not be sanctioned yet, but if they were arrested for fraud yesterday, Adverse Media catches it."

---

## 4. Risk Assessment (The Grading Phase)
### 📊 Risk Scoring
* **What it is:** An algorithm that assigns a risk level (Low, Medium, High) based on geography, occupation, and matches.
* **Talking Point:** "We don't treat everyone the same; we allocate resources based on a calculated risk score."

### 🔍 CDD (Customer Due Diligence)
* **What it is:** The standard check for most users. Verifying ID and understanding the intended nature of the account.
* **Talking Point:** "This is our baseline 'Level 1' check for the average user."

### 🕵️ EDD (Enhanced Due Diligence)
* **What it is:** A deep-dive investigation for High-Risk users (PEPs, High-Net-Worth). Requires proving Source of Funds/Wealth.
* **Talking Point:** "For high-risk users, we go deeper. We need to know exactly how they made their money before we accept it."

## 5. Ongoing Defense (The Maintenance Phase)
### 📉 Transaction Monitoring
* **What it is:** Automated software that watches money movement for suspicious patterns (e.g., structuring deposits to hide amounts).
* **Talking Point:** "KYC doesn't stop at onboarding. We monitor transaction behaviors 24/7 to catch anomalies."
