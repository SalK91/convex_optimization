GPT is trained through a multi-stage pipeline designed to gradually improve its knowledge, reasoning, alignment, and usefulness. This process consists of four key stages, each with its own purpose and techniques:

Pretraining: The model is trained on vast amounts of raw internet text to learn general language patterns, grammar, facts, and reasoning. At this stage, it becomes good at predicting the next word but is not yet fine-tuned for helpful or safe responses.


Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): Human experts provide high-quality examples of ideal question-answer pairs. The model learns to imitate helpful, context-aware, and instruction-following responses based on these demonstrations.

Reward Modeling (RM): Human trainers compare multiple model-generated responses and select the better one. Using these preferences, a reward model is trained to judge response quality. This model guides future optimization.
Reinforcement Learning (RLHF): The model generates responses, and the reward model scores them. Using reinforcement learning, the model improves itself to produce more helpful, safe, and aligned answers, maximizing quality and user satisfaction.
